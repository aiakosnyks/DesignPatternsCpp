**Real-World Example of the Factory Method in C++

Imagine you want to build different types of things, like toys. You have a general idea of how toys are made, but you want different
people to make different kinds of toys

The Factory Method is like a plan for making toys, but it doesn’t specify exactly what kind of toy you’re making.
It lets you create a plan (a method) that says, This is how you make a toy, without saying which toy it is.
Other people (subclasses) can use your plan to make their own types of toys. They just have to follow your plan and fill in the details
for their specific toy.
This way you can make various toys without knowing exactly which one you’re making. It also keeps things neat and organized because each
type of toy has its own set of instructions (a class) to follow.
In simple terms, the Factory Method Pattern is like a recipe for making things, but it lets different chefs (subclasses) create their own
unique versions of those things while sticking to the same basic cooking instructions (the Factory Method).

-Core Components of the Factory Method Pattern in C++

//Let’s break down the key participants of the Factory Method Pattern:

1. Creator (Abstract Creator)

Description: An abstract class or interface responsible for declaring the factory method, which returns an object of a product type. The Creator
Class can also contain other method that rely on the factory method to create objects.
Purpose: Provides a common interface for creating objects, but the specific object creation is defereed to concrete creators.


2. Concrete Creator:

Description: Concrete subclasses of the Creator. Each concrete creator implements the factory method declared in the abstract creator,
returning a specific type of product.
Purpose: Responsible for creating instances of concrete products, thus encapsulating the actual object creation logic.


3. Product(Abstract Product):

Description: The abstract class or interface for the objects the factory method creates. It defines the common interface that all products
must implement.
Purpose: Specifies the interface that concrete products must adhere to, ensuring that they have a consistent set of methods.


4. Concrete Product:

Description: Concrete implementations of the Product interface. Each concrete product represents a distinct type of object.
Purpose: Defines the acutal objects that the factory method creates. Each concrete product has its own implementation of the methods specified
in teh Product interface.


5. Client:

Description: The client code interacts with the Creator through the abstarct Creator class and relies on the factory method to create instances of products.
Purpose: Utilizes the factory method pattern to create objects without needing to know specific class 

-This implementation demonstrates the Factory Method Pattern, where:

+The abstract creator (ShapeFactory) defines the factory method (createShape())
+Concrete creators (CircleFactory and SquareFactory) implement this method to create concrete prodcuts (Circle and Square).
+The client code interacts with the abstract creator, creating products without needing to know their specific types.

This promotes flexibility and decoupling between the client and product classes.


//Real-World Use Cases of the Factory Method Pattern in C++ Design Patterns
The Factory Method Pattern finds application in various real-wrold scenarios, such as:

+GUI Libraries: GUI frameworks often use this pattern for creating UI components like buttons, windows, and dialogs. Different operating systems
may have different implementations for these components.
+Database Drivers: Database connectivity libraries may use the Factory Method Pattern to create specific database dirver objects depending on the
type of database being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
+Game Development: In game development, this pattern is used to create different types of game objects, characters, or weapons.
+Plugin Systems: When building extensible software systems, the Factory Method Pattern can be used to create and manage plugin instances dynamically.


**Advantages of the Factory Method Pattern in C++ Design Patterns

+Flexibility: It allows you to add new product types or change the way objects are created without modifying existing client code.
+Encapsulation: The creation logic is encapsualted withing the concrete creators, promoting information hiding and modularity.
+Maintainability: The pattern enhances code maitainability by isolating object creation code.
+Testing: You easily substitue different product types with mock objects for testing purposes.


**Disadvantages of the Factory Method Pattern in C++ Design Patterns

+Increased Complexity: Introduces more classes and potential tight coupling, making the codebase more complex.
+Tight Coupling: Concrete creators may be tightly linked to specific products, making changes cumbersome.
+Limited to One Product Family: Best suited for single product families; not ideal for handlng multiple families.
+Runtime Overhead: Some languages may introduce minor runtime overhead.
+Potential Misuse: Can overcomplicate code if used unnecessarily.

**Conclusion
The Factory Method Pattern is a valuable tool in C++ for achieving flexible and extensible object creation mechanisms. By abstracting the creation
process into separate factory methods, you can write more maintainable, modular and testable code. It is a fundamental patten to have in your arsenal
when designing object-oriented systems, offering a solution to the often complex problem of object instantiation.
