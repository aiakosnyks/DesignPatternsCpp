**Key Concepts of the Observer Pattern**

Before diving into the implementation of the Observer Pattern in C++, let’s understand its key components:

+Subject: This is the object that is being observed. It maintains a list of observers and notifies them of state changes.
+Observer: Observers are objects that are interested in the state changes of the subject. They register with the subject to receive updates.
+Concrete Subject: The concrete subject class inherits from the subject interface or class and is responsible for maintaining the state and notifying observers when changes occur.
+Concrete Observer: Concrete observers implement the observer interface or inherit from an observer class. They register themselves with a concrete subject and react to state changes.

//Problem statement: Suppose you are developing a weather monitoring application, in which multiple weather stations are responsible for collecting weather data, and you want to create a
system where multiple displays can show real-time weather updates. When a weather station collects new data, all registered displays should be updated automatically with the latest information.

**Code Explaination:

We defined an Observer interface with an update method that concrete observers must implement to display weather data.
The WeatherStation class serves as the subject. It maintains the weather data (temperature, humidity, and pressure) and a list of registered observers.
It provides methods to register, remove, and notify observers, as well as setting measurements and triggering updates.
The Display class is a concrete observer that implements the update method to display weather data.

-In the main function:
we create a WeatherStation instance and two Display instances, which act as observers.
We register the displays with the weather station, and then simulate weather data updates.

//Advantages of the Observer Pattern in C++ Design Patterns
+Decoupling: The Observer Pattern promotes loose coupling between subjects and observers. Subjects don’t need to know the concrete types of their observers.
+Scalability: You can easily add or remove observers without modifying the subject. This makes it a flexible solution for systems with dynamic requirements.
+Reusability: Observers can be reused in different contexts, provided they adhere to the observer interface or class.
+Event Handling: The pattern is instrumental in event handling systems, such as GUI frameworks, where components need to respond to user actions.

//Disadvantages of the Observer Pattern in C++ Design Patterns
+Memory and Performance Overhead: The use of dynamic lists of observers can introduce memory overhead, and notifying many observers can have a performance impact in large-scale systems.
+Order of Notification: The order in which observers are notified might be significant in some cases, but the pattern doesn’t inherently guarantee a specific order.
+Unintended Updates: Observers can receive updates even when they are not interested in certain changes, leading to potentially unnecessary processing.
