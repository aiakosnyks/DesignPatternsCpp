The builder pattern is defined as a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a
complex object from its representation, allowing us to create different representations of an object
using the same construction process. It’s beneficial when an object has many optional properties or
configurations.

The logic behind the Builder Pattern is to separate the construction of an object from its representations.
This separation basically enables us to create different representations of an object using the
same construction process.

**Key components of the Builder Pattern in C++


-Director: The Director is the main component of the builder pattern it basically responsible for the
construction process of the program. It works with a Builder to build an object. The Director knows the
actual steps required to build an object, but it does not know the details of how each step is implemented.

-Builder: The Builder is the main interface or an abstract class that defines the construction steps
required to create an object.

-Concrete Builder: Basically, these are the classes that implement the Builder interface. Each Concrete
Builder is responsible for constructing a particular variant of the object.

-Product: The Product is the complex object that we want to create. The Product class may have methods
to access or manipulate these components. It often has multiple parts or components that are built by
the Builder.

*Computer: The product class that we want to build.
*ComputerBuilder: An abstract class defining the builder interface.
*DesktopComputerBuilder: A concrete builder class implementing the ComputerBuilder interface for building desktop computers.
*ComputerAssembler: The director class responsible for orchestrating the construction process.

1. “Pizza” is the product class that we want to build.
2. “PizzaBuilder” is an abstract builder class that defines the steps to build a pizza and provides
a method to get the final pizza.
3.“HawaiianPizzaBuilder” and “SpicyPizzaBuilder” are concrete builder classes that implement the
4. “PizzaBuilder” interface to construct specific types of pizzas.
5. “Cook” is the director class that orchestrates the construction process, taking a builder and calling
the necessary build methods to create a pizza.
6. In the “main” function, we create instances of different builders and use the Cook class to build
pizzas with specific characteristics.

//Advantages of the Builder Patterns in C++


+Complex Object Creation: It simplifies the creation of complex objects by breaking down the construction
process into a series of well-defined steps. Each step focuses on a specific aspect of the object’s
configuration.

+Reusability: Builders can be reused to create similar objects with different configurations.
This reusability can lead to more efficient and maintainable code.

+Parameter Validation: Builders can validate the parameters during the construction process, ensuring
that only valid configurations are used to create objects.


//Disadvantages of the Builder Patterns in C++


+Code Overhead: Implementing the Builder Pattern may require writing additional code for the builder
classes, which can make the codebase more complex, especially for simple objects.

+Learning Curve: Developers who are not familiar with the Builder Pattern may need some time to understand
its concept and how to implement it correctly.

+Potential for Incomplete Objects: If the client code forgets to call certain builder methods,
it’s possible to create incomplete or inconsistent objects, leading to runtime errors.


**Conclusion

Builder Patterns are valuable design pattern for creating complex objects with a clear and flexible
construction process. It offers advantages such as reusability, and parameter validation. However,
it also comes with some overhead in terms of code and may require a learning curve for developers who
are new to the pattern.
